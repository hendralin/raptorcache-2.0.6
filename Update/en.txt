Installation and configuration of RaptorCache-2.0.6 using Debian 8.11 (jessie) & MikroTik RouterOS 6.x, Supported with Squid-3.5.20

In this tutorial, we use OS Debian 8.11 (jessie) which was created by the official developer of RaptorCache. 

The installation and configuration process is quite easy and faster than the previous tutorial that uses Linux Ubuntu-18.04.x, it's just that Squid still uses version 3.5.20

The installation file can be downloaded at the following link:
